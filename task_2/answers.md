# Part 2

For part 2 I wrote a set of solutions which can be run with different repetitions and array
sizes on the command line. However, all recorded times for these three implementations are for
1 repetition with an array of 1000 * 1000

### Implementation 1

Run time: 1.2307 seconds

### Implementation 2

Run time: 1.1541 seconds

### Implementation 3
